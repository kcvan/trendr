Trendr

## A trend visualization app for Twitter ##

  Have you ever wondered what is trending and where? Trendr is a new way to quickly and easily see trends across the US in an easy to use, easy to understand format. See the progress of trends over time, learn about events as they occur, or just check out what's going on in your favorite cities all at the click of a button...with Trendr.
  
### Problem ###
   Previously seeing what was going on on Twitter required you to actually be on Twitter and have a working knowledge of its complex search system. Even still there was no intuitive way to break down the trends by location or see their progression over time. 
  
### Solution ###
   Trendr's intuitive interface allows active Twitter users and even non-"digital natives" to see the current most popular hashtags broken down by location. Viewing Twitter data has never been this `#easy`.
